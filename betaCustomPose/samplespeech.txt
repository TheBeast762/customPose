Hello everyone.
Thank you all for coming.
Welcome to today's presentation.
This is an experimental situation to test the capabilities of this software.
The text is divided into parts which are all highlighted with different emotions.
The speech recognition is used as an indicator to know what part of the speech the user is currently at.
The user's movements are tracked in order to stimulate a dynamic pose while presenting.
This is done through the use of icon feedback in the User Interface.
